= Viscosity of Lava (Treacle) vs Crystal Content (Sand)

NOTE: Viscosity, __"The resistance of a fluid to flow."__

== Prediction
The higher the crystal content the more viscose the material

== Method

. Get 3 test tubes of treacle.
. Label the 1, 2, 3. This will be the number of spatulas of sand to add.
. Add the required amount of sand to the tubes.
. Mix the sand through the treacle.
. On all three test tubes make two markings. One just above the treacle another
  5cm (0.05m) further up the tube
. Rotate each tube 30&deg;.
. For each tube do:
.. When the treacle passes the first marker start a stop watch.
.. When it passes the second stop the stop watch.
. Use the equation stem:[v = d / t] where stem:[d = 0.5m] and
  stem:[t = the recorded time].

|==================================================
| Tube / Spatulas of sand | Time (s) | Speed ms^-1^
|            1            |   35.0   |    1.750
|            2            |   26.9   |    1.345
|            3            |   25.6   |    1.280
|==================================================

== Conclusion
The greater the solid content of a fluid the the higher the viscosity.
