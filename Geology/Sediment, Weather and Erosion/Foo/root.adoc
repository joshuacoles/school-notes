= Weathering and Erosion

== Chemical Weathering Definitions
Hydrolysis::
  Minerals breaking down by reacting with water. Under acidic conditions
  feldspar breaks down into kaolin (clay minerals).

Carbonation::
  Reaction of mineral with the carbonic acid produced by the solution of CO~2~
  in water.

Oxidation::
  When minerals combine with Oxygen. A red-brown weathering crust develops on
  iron-containing rocks.

== Dynamic Deposition

.Processes on the surface of the Earth
Weathering:: The breakdown of rocks in situ (no transport)
Erosion:: Wearing down of rocks involving movement.
Transportation:: The movement of a substance.
Deposition:: When a substance is deposited from the stream of a fluid, normally water.

.Types of Transport Agents (erosion)
  - Gravity
  - Ice
  - Wind
  - Water
