= Granite Tors

== What is it?
A large free-standing rock outcrop rising above the surrounding landscape.
It is made when a batholith intrudes into the crust however the softer
country rock is eroded/weathered away with time. The cracks form when the rock
is cooling and contracting and when it is un-convered and the pressure released.
These are then amplified by freeze thaw weathering.
