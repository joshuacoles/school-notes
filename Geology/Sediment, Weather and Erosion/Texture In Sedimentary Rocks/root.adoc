= Texture of Sedimentary Rocks

Fragmental or clastic (made of broken particles)

== Classifications
Shape::
  Round or angular
Size::
  Fine;; <1/16mm
  Medium;; 1/16mm -> 2mm
  Coarse;; >2mm
Sorting::
  The range of sizes. Well sorted, the same size. Poorly sorted,
  large range.

== Sorting
The measure of sorted ranges from very well sorted to extremely poorly sorted depending on the range of sediment sizes present in the sample.

The sorting can provide information on how the sediment was transported. Wind does not transport very coarse grains and the ones it does are deposited based on their size with the finer grains being transported further.

Rivers flowing with high energy may transport coarse, medium or fine grained sediments however as the velocity of the water decreases the grains will be deposited the coarser ones first.

The more well sorted a sediment is the more it has been transported as they have experienced more abrasion (with the ground) and attrition (with other sediment).

Glacial clasts are often scratched (called striations).

When comparing grains that have been transported by ice and that by wind you would see a much less sorted sample from the ice. This is due to the the fact that the wind is not powerful enough and air dense enough to pick up large grains ensuring that the are relatively well sorted before attrition ever takes place.

glacier: `(3 - -1.6) / 2 = 2.3` (poorly sorted)

river: `(0.9 - -0.6) / 2 = 0.75` (moderatly sorted)

dune sand: `(2 - 1.1) / 2 = 0.45` (well sorted)

beach: `(0.8 - -0.1) / 2 = 0.45` (well sorted)
