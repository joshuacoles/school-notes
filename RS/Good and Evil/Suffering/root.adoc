= Christ's Suffering

The suffering of Christ:

Christians believe that God is able to understand and relate to human suffering
because Jesus came to Earth and suffered.

Jesus died and agonising death despite asking God if it was possible not to go
through with such pain - rs:quote[Luke 22:42]. Times of suffering make many
Christians feel closer to God as they rely on him for strength and support.

Christians will see from this quote that Jesus prayed to God prayed to God when
he was suffering but also accepted God's will - that God had a plan.

== How does faith help Christians cope with suffering?

- Faith in God and the example of Jesus help most Christians cope with
  suffering.
- The Bible promises Christians that they will be rewarded for their faith and
  courage after death.
- St. Paul wrote 'I consider that our present sufferings are not worth
  comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us'.
