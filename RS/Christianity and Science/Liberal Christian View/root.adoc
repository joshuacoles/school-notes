The majority of Christians *accept the Big Bang* theory of creation and that God may have caused in (Thomas Aquinas -- Cosmological Argument - taught that God was the first cause).

Many Christians believe that science correctly observes how the universe originated, and the Bible gives a *symbolic* version of the same event

The 'days' in the Genesis account represents the same periods of time that explain evolution.

The Catholic Church finally accepted Darwin's theory in *1996*.

The Genesis account is not thought of as *historical*, but an explanation of the world's purpose.

These Christians believe God is to be *praised* for the purpose he has given the world. Genesis is an answer of the question *"Do humans have a purpose"*.
