.Source A (72)
This source shows that Churchill is getting increasingly worried about the communist threat, the domino effect and Soviet influence in Europe.

.Source B (72)
This source shows that Stalin is trying to accuse Churchill of warmongering and implying that the US and UK are teaming up against the USSR.

These sources show how the war time alliance had broken down over differing ideologies once the common enemy had been removed. This can be seen in Churchill's speech were he says "Soviet sphere and all are subject". The negative connotations of the word "subject" implies that Churchill does not look kindly upon this and feels threatened. This is again shown in Source B where Stalin accuses Churchill of "warmongering" and directly compares Churchill and the US to Hitler and the Nazis.
