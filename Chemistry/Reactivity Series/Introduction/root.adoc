     Least Reactive
--------

A more reactive metal will *displace* the metal ions of a less reactive metal compound.

.Example 1
Zn~(s)~ (Gray Solid) + CuSO~4~~(aq)~ (Blue Solution) --> Cu(II)~(s)~ (Red Solid) + ZnSO~4~~(aq)~ (Colourless Solution)

Conclusion: zinc is more reactive than copper.

If no reaction occurs, the metal is less reactive.

.Exmaple 2: Thermite
2Al~(s)~ + Fe~2~O~3~~(s) --> Al~2~O~2~~(s)~ + 2Fe~(s)~

.Exmaple 3
Cu~(s)~ + 2AgNO~3~~(aq)~ --> Cu)(II)(NO~3~)~2~~(aq)~ + 2 Ag~(s)~
