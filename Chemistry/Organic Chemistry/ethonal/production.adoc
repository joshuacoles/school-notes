== Production

=== Ethanol From Sugar

C~6~H~12~O~6~ -> 2 CH~3~CH~2~OH + 2 CO~2~

Yeast and sugary solution at about 37&deg;^C^

The enzymes break down the glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide.

A weak solution of ethanol in water is produced. This is ideal for
making wine (about 12% ethonal) and beer (about 3% ethonal).

Fractional distillation is used to obtain higher concentrations of ethanol
(40%) in spirits like whisky, gin and vodka.

=== Ethanol From Ethene

Hydration Reaction

CH~2~=CH~2~~(g)~ + H~2~O~(g)~ -> CH~3~-CH~2~-OH

Ethene (a gas) and steam (gaseous water) are passed over phosphoric acid (H~3~PO~4~), the catalyst.

Temperature of about 300&deg;^C^ and a pressure of about 60-70 atm (atmospheric pressure).

== Dehydration

Ethanol vapour is passed over hot alumninium oxide (Al~2~O~3~), the catalyst.

C~2~H~6~O~(g)~ -> C~2~H~4~(g) + H~2~O~(l)~
