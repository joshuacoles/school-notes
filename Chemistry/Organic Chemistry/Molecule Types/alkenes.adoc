== Alkenes

Alkenes are a family of hydrocarbons compounds with the general formula
of C~n~H~2n~

NOTE: Alkenes are *unsaturated* hydrocarbons.
      They contain at least one double covalent bonds between carbon atoms.


Alkenes are homologous series for the same reasons as the alkanes.

An alkene contains one double covalent bond between carbon atoms.

The simplest alkane is ethene. It has the formula of C~2~H~4~
