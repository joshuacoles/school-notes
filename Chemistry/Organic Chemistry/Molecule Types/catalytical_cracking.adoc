== Catalytic Cracking

Type:: Thermal Decomposition.
Input:: A long chain alkane such as liquid paraffin (C~20~H~42~).
Output:: A series of smaller alkanes and alkenes.
Temperature:: 600-700&deg;^c^
Catalyst:: Pumice, aluminium oxide or pieces of ceramic or zeolites (in
           industry)
Uses:: Increase fuel supply by splitting un-volitle long hydrocarbons into more
       volatile small chains +
       Produce alkenes for making polymers

WARNING: Before cracking you must remove sulphur. Which, when burned, forms
         SO~2~ causing acid rain.
