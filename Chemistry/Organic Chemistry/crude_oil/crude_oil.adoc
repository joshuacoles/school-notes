== Crude Oil

=== Formation
          Remains of plants and animals that dies millions of years ago.
        - 200M years ago.
        - Seas full of life.
        - Dies but no O2 for decomposition so energy trapped.
        - Layers form above the dead material.
        - Pressure + heat builds up.
        - Breaks down deposited organic remains into molecules that
          form crude oil and natural gas.
        - Oil forced up till it reaches a non-porous material and forms
          a reservoir.
=== Uses
Release stored energy (alkanes)
Plastics and Polymers (alkenes)

=== Composition
Mixture of different hydrocarbons (100,000s)

=== Obtained
Extracted by drilling through see beds. Then piped to refineries.

=== Drawbacks
.Burning
- Global Warming
- Global Dimming
- Air Pollution

.Drilling
- Oil spills

.Other
- High value can cause conflict (large amount of oil come from
  countries that are politically unstable).
  
    - Distillation
        - Fractional Distillation
            - Hot crude oil (>300ËšC) is pumped into the bottom.
            - The very longest alkanes have the strongest
              intermolecular forces and so do not boil, but exit the
              column at the bottom.
            - This tick black liquid is Bitumen (tar).
            - Other fractions rise though the column, passing through
              bubble caps which slowly cool them.
            - At each tray of bobble-caps the longest remaining
              molecules condensed exist to the sides as liquids.
            - Only, the very strongest molecules make it to the top of
              the tower without condensing. These gases are then cooled
              and compressed to for LPG - Liquid Petroleum Gas.
