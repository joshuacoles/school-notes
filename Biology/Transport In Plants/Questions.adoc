. Osmosis is the process that is causing the change in the masses of the chips.
. Solution A as the most mass, water, was lost from the chip and it moved into
  the sucrose solution.
. Solution C as the most mass, water, was gained by the chip from the sucrose
  solution.
. Solution B as the chip experienced the least change in mass.
. A partially permeable membrane is a membrane that allows somethings to permeate
  through it but not all.

Explain how each cell is adapted to its function:

Root Hair::
[none]
  - Has long, thin outer root projections that penetrate between the soil particles.

  - Ensures there is a very high concentration of mineral ions in the cell
    through active transport.

  - This leads to a low &Psi; inside the cell and a high &Psi; outside the cell
    in the soil causing osmosis.

Xylem Vessel::
[none]
  - Hollow (no cytoplasm)
  - Walls contain lignin (woody material)
  * Very strong
  * Lignin impermeable to water

Guard Cell::
[none]
  - Unusual "banana" shape.
  - Part of the cell wall near the stoma is particularly thick.
  - Bend outwards when turgid.
  - Water is drawn in in the light.
