= Transpiration Stream

$(date)

- Water evaporates from the leaves
- Moves up the xylem to replace it through adhesion and cohesion (requires unbroken column of water)
- Water moves from the from the roots to the stem
- This lowers the &Phi; in the root causing more water to enter the leaves.

== Transpiration
The loss of water by evaporation from the leaves of the plant.

The presence of an impermeable waxy cuticle over the epidermis reduces water loss.

So the main loss is through the stomata

== Adaptions
.Thick waxy cuticle
- Cuts water loss
- Strengthens the leaf

- Water layer on outside of mesophyll cells.
- Water vapor.
- Diffusion H~2~O through stomata.
