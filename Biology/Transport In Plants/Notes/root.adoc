= Transport in Plants

toc::[]

== What do we need to transport?
- Mineral ions
- Water
- Glucose
- Gases
  * CO~2~
  * O~2~

== Water
Water is lost from the leaves.

Constant stream of: transpiration stream.

.Process
- Absorbed from the soil through osmosis.
* Has a low water potential due to the high concentration of minerals moved in
  through active transport from the soil.
* Moved through <<Xylem>> to other cells

NOTE: When fields flood the roots are starved of Oxygen so cannot do
      active transport so have a higher water potential than normal.

The water is moved by the pull of the water at the leaves on the
water at the roots.

== Vascular (Transport) Tissues

All in the middle of root. Means the growing tip always has access to the
resources.

The xylem and phloem are surrounded by packing tissue cambium.

NOTE: In a root the xylem are in the center to provide support and as an anchor

NOTE: In a stem they are spread evenly around the center (in a ring) to provide
      support in wind.

=== Xylem
NOTE: Water is both cohesive (sticks to its self) and adhesive (sticks to other
      things). Due to this the xylem is a constant flow of water.

Dead

Water proof

One directional

They are the central core of the root tissue. Serves well to anchor
it to the ground (very strong).

Transports water and minerals

Completely hollow

=== Phloem
ALIVE!!!!!!!

Translocates sugars and food materials up and down the plant in the
form of sap.

NOTE: Moved by active transport so requires a lot of energy and has
      companion cells with a large number mitochondria (why they
      appear full)

== Root Hairs
Absorbs water.

Has a water proof root cap to protect the root as it grows into the ground

Specialised epidermis cells

Has a very thin cell wall

.Water Transport
. Mineral ions are transported into the cell by active transport
  (requires energy) to decrease the &Psi;.
. This means there is a steeper &Psi; gradient and water
  travels faster.
