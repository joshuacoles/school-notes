= Transport in Plants

== What do we need to transport?
- Mineral ions
- Water
- Glucose
- Gases
  * CO~2~
  * O~2~

== Water
Water is lost from the leaves.

Constant stream of: transpiration stream.

.Process
- Absorbed from the soil through osmosis.
* Has a low water potential due to the high concentration of minerals moved in
  through active transport from the soil.
* Moved through <<Xylem>> to other cells

NOTE: When fields flood the roots are starved of Oxygen so cannot do active
      transport so have a higher water potential than normal.

The water is moved by the pull of the water at the leaves on the
water at the roots.

== Vascular (Transport) Tissues

All in the middle of root. Means the growing tip always has access to the
resources.

=== Xylem
NOTE: Water is both cohesive (sticks to its self) and adhesive (sticks to other
      things). Due to this the xylem is a constant flow of water.

Dead

=== Phloem
ALIVE!!!!!!!
