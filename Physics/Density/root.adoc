= Density

Density is a property of a material not the property of an object.

Density is the amount of mass (kg) contained within a certain volume.

====
Density is defined by the equation:

Density = mass/volume

&rho; = m/V

Measured in kg/m^3^ or kgm^-3^.

The density of water is 1 gcm^-3^ or 1000 kgm^-3^. This shows the conversion rate is gcm^-3^ * 1000 = kgm^-3^

== Measuring Densities
- Measure the mass of the object using a balance.
- Place the object in a full eureka can, ensuring that it is fully submerged (pushing it gently as needed) and measure the volume of water displaced.
- Use these values in the equation `density = mass / volume`
