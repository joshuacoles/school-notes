= Hooke's Law Experiment

== Aim
To determine the behavior of a spring within the elastic limit

== Diagram

== Method
. Setup as per the diagram.
. Check the spring has not exceeded its elastic limit by attempting to compress
  it, if it compresses it has exceeded its elastic limit and needs to be replaced.
. Measure on the ruler the position of the bottom of the spring when it is at rest.
. For a weight of 1-6 N repeat 2 times per:
.. Hang the specified weight onto the spring.
.. Guide the weight down until it supports itself to ensure it does not bounce.
.. Measure the new position of the bottom of the spring.
.. Minus the original position from this to obtain the extension distance.
.. Perform the check described in step 2 repeating the experiment again with
   the new spring if fails.
.. Record the result.
