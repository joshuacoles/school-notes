= Investigating the forces on a balanced beam

== Aim
To determine how the forces supporting a beam vary as the position of
a load moves between two supports.

== Hypothesis
The vertical support forces should balance the weight (&sum;F = 5N)

Beams act as two pivot points and two counter moments (principle of
moments must apply).

== Diagram

== Method
. Setup the apparatus as per the diagram.
. Zero the newton meters to eliminate the effect of the weight of the
  ruler.
. At 20cm increments from 0cm to 100cm do 3 times:
.. Place the weight at the point on the ruler.
.. Record the readings on the newton meters.

== Conclusion
Our hypothesis that the sum of the support forces would balance the 5N
weight has been proven as the results show &sum;F = 5N

For the second hypothesis the proof is below:
....
In balance:
  counter clockwise moments = clockwise moments
                      5 x d = F1 x 100
                     5 x 20 = 1 x 100
                        100 = 100
....

This proves that the beam acts inline with the principle of moments

== Evaluation
I have a high level of confidence with my conclusion as they fit with
previous knowledge and the results follow predictable trends.
