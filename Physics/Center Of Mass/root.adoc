= Center of Mass/Gravity

Objects have their mass distributed throughout their volume however there is
one point with in volume of the mass where the mass can be thought to be evenly
distributed around. This is called the *Center of Mass* and we can think of the
object as having all its mass concentrated at that point.

As weight is the force of gravity acting on a mass, we can also think of the
force of gravity as acting at that point. When we are thinking about the
influence of the force of gravity, we say it acts on the center of gravity.
