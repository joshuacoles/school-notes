= Moments
:stem: latexmath

When a force is applied &perp; to a "pivot" point, a turning effect
is produced. Turning forces are called call *"moments"*.

stem:[moment = force * distance]

When the force is measured in Newtons and the distance is measured in meters the
moment is measured in Nm (newton meters).

*Moments are NOT the same as mechanical work done.*

The difference is:

  - Work done is measured in Joules and moments are measured in Newton meters

  - In work done energy is transferred where as a moment does not transfer
    energy.

  - In work done the distance traveled is in the direction of the force where as
    in a moment the distance is perpendicular to the force.

  - Work done would produce a change in kinetic energy where as a moment does
    not.

== Balancing

An object is in "equilibrium" (balenced) when the sum of the clockwise
moments are equal to the sum of the anti-clockwise moments.

&sum; clockwise moments = &sum; anti-clockwise moments
