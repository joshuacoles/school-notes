The mass of the brick was determined by using a 1kg mass, a pivot and a ruler. todo:[Include diagram of brick and 1kg masses with distances to balance of 16in for the 1kg and 6in for the mass].

1 * 16 = m_b * 6

   m_b = 16/6
       = 2.67kg

V = 0.095 * 0.055 * 0.195 = 1.02 * 10_(-3)m^3

The density of the brick is given by equation asciimath:[&rho; = m/V].
[asciimath]
++++
&rho; = m/V = 2.67/1.02 * 10^(-3) = 2617kgm^(-3)

The weight of the brick is given by the equation asciimath:[W = mg].
