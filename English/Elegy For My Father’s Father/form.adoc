- Very long (possibly represents his life?).
- Un-edding until it ends on "And his heart was unafraid.".
* Terminal cesura -- ending it.
* Has a very final tone.
* Rounds up the poem with a continuation of the theme of men being strong and unaffected by emotions.
- Shows enjambment -- pushes the poem forward.
* Like time and life.
